    <p>
      This Tubelox build was intentionally slow.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a multi-cat household, speed can change everything. Fast builds, quick
      reveals, and sudden changes can create pressure, even when the structure
      itself is positive. For this build, I wanted to remove urgency from the
      process entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of assembling everything at once, the build unfolded gradually.
      This gave the cats time to observe from a distance, approach when ready,
      and disengage without feeling overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A slower pace allowed me to notice more subtle behaviors — hesitation,
      curiosity, confidence, and moments of quiet return. Those moments tell me
      far more than immediate excitement ever could.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach also made it easier to adjust spacing and layout without
      disrupting the cats’ sense of safety. Nothing felt permanent or forced,
      which mattered just as much as the final structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal wasn’t to create a dramatic transformation. It was to create
      something that could become part of the room, part of the routine, and
      part of a regulated environment.
    </p>

    <p class="soft">
      This build reflects the belief that enrichment works best when animals
      are given time, choice, and space.
