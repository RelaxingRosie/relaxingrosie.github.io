    <h1>What We Learned Building a Tubelox Structure</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      We built a Tubelox modular structure in our home to see how our cats would
      actually use it when they were given real choice. Not as a staged setup or
      a quick test, but as something that had to live in the space with them.
      This article shares what we’ve observed over time, not just a first impression.

    <p>
      In a multi-cat household, enrichment only works when it feels safe, optional,
      and flexible. That has always been our baseline. We weren’t looking for
      something decorative or overstimulating, and we weren’t trying to introduce
      a “feature” that demanded attention. What we wanted was a structure the cats
      could approach on their own terms, or ignore completely, without pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the first things we noticed was how quickly the structure stopped
      feeling new. Instead of becoming a novelty that sparked excitement for a
      day or two and then faded, it blended into the room almost immediately.
      It didn’t change the emotional tone of the space. It simply became part of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Different cats gravitated toward different levels, and not in a fixed or
      predictable way. Usage shifted throughout the day depending on mood,
      energy level, and what else was happening nearby. Sometimes it was used
      for climbing or observing. Other times it functioned more like a pause
      point, a place to sit quietly and watch. And sometimes, it was ignored
      entirely, which in a multi-cat home is just as important.
    </p>

    <p>
      What mattered most to us was that there was no single “correct” way for the
      cats to interact with it. In households with multiple animals, forced
      interaction can create stress, even when intentions are good. Structures
      that demand engagement or funnel animals into narrow pathways often work
      against a cat’s need for autonomy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The modular nature of this system allowed us to adjust spacing, height,
      and layout without removing the structure entirely. That flexibility
      helped preserve a sense of safety, especially for more reserved or
      sensitive cats. As dynamics shift, whether that’s changes in energy,
      routines, or simply cats being cats, the structure can shift with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, the structure has become less about enrichment in the
      traditional sense and more about choice. It offers vertical space without
      demand. Presence without pressure. It exists in the room without asking
      anything from the cats, which is often when they choose to engage on
      their own.
    </p>

    <p class="soft">
      This article will continue to evolve as our cats keep using the structure
      and showing us what actually works for them.
