    <p>
      This Tubelox build wasn’t designed to be flashy or complicated. 
      It was designed to be observed.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I build enrichment for my cats, especially in a multi-cat household, 
      I try not to force outcomes. I don’t build what I <em>think</em> they should use.
      I build structures that allow them to show me what they choose.
    </p>

    <p>
      This particular build was created as a “show build” — a calm, open structure 
      where access points, height, and flow mattered more than aesthetics alone.
      I wanted to see how each cat approached it, how long they stayed, 
      and whether it became part of their routine rather than a novelty.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the things I appreciate about Tubelox is the flexibility. 
      I can adjust layouts without tearing everything down, which is important 
      when you’re working with animals who communicate through behavior rather than words.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this video, you’ll see moments of hesitation, curiosity, confidence, 
      and quiet use. Those moments matter to me more than instant excitement.
      Calm engagement is the goal.
    </p>

    <p>
      This build is part of a larger series where I let the cats lead, 
      and I simply document what happens when the environment supports regulation 
      instead of overstimulation.
